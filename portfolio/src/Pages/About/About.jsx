      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of
        Technology with a deep passion for computers and technology. I am
        particularly fascinated by software development and the field of
        artificial intelligence. I am committed to continuous learning and
        improvement, spending time each day either developing software or
        expanding my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        My enthusiasm for what I do drives me to seek knowledge from various
        sources, including fellow students, instructors, and the people I
        encounter in my daily life. I am also an avid reader; while I have
        enjoyed fiction in the past, my current focus is on self-improvement
        literature. One of my favorite books is Atomic Habits, which has greatly
        influenced my approach to personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond honing my technical skills, I am dedicated to improving myself on
        an emotional level as well. I believe in the importance of balancing
        professional development with personal well-being, and I strive to grow
        in both areas every day.
